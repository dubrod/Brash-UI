# Brash UI

> Brash doesn't give you BASSCSS type modularity. Brash tells you what markup to use. And you will like it.

### Common Questions

 - Where's the Java?. I am not including any Javascripts in this UI.
 - What's with the Outline? It's for debugging/building box sizing and a11y focus.

---

### Type

 - BODY starts the type scale at 15px
 - Define your Font Families in the `VARS`
 - No granular Type Components like blockquotes,list,etc

---

 ### Spacing

 - `VARS` has 1 Gutter variable to keep EVERYTHING EQUAL
 - Not a single `float:`

---

### Role Styling

 - `role=banner` equals the top "HEADER"
 - `role=navigation` equals the top "NAV"
 - `role=search` equals the top Search
 - `role=complimentary` equals the "Sidebar"
